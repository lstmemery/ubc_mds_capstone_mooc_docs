# Questions:

1. How to access to data? Any chance we can take a look at it in advance?
2. Looking at the already existing visualizations, how should what we are making differ?
3. In the proposal it says "Do learners find value in the course? What? How are they using the courses?". As mentioned in the presentation, this will be a very hard thing to measure. What are the best ways we can evaluate what learners think is important? Surveys? Do we have survey data?
