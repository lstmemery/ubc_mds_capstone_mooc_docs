Leah - Deals in data flow between courses

Video plot:
 - Change font color
 - Change color order
 - Clear demarcation between course section
 - Mark optional?
 
 Page Analytics
  - There may be landing pages
  - Ido doubts how reliable this is
  - Page navigation events may not be logged
  - Next links
  - Factor in the bounce rate (time on one page)
  - Maybe remove videos
  - Session times are more important

Last question answered
 - Shouldn't be called today
 - Where is the dropout they care about
 
Discussion Forum Wordcloud
 - Prefer the non-circle clouds
 - Natlytic 
 - Stemming
 - Stopwords
 
Sentiment Analysis
 - Needs explanation
 - Maybe use confusing (this would be a lot of work)
 - Metrics based forum post
