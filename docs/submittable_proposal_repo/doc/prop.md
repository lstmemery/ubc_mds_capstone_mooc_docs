## Written Capstone Project Proposal

### General instructions:
rubric={mechanics:2}

- *Write your proposal using complete sentences and proper grammar. Make sure everything is written in your own words.*

- Ensure this submission (*i.e.,* your Github repo) meets our basic requirements: https://github.ubc.ca/ubc-mds-2016/general/blob/master/general_lab_instructions.md

### Report Instructions:
rubric={reasoning:10,writing:10}

As a group, you are to collaboratively write a proposal for your Capstone project. This takes the form of a formal document and is the first deliverable of the project. The proposal must include the following sections:

- An executive summary
- A definition of the work to be completed, including:
  - Availability of appropriate data
  - Identification of risks and mitigation strategies
  - Deliverables (e.g., minimal viable product (MVP))
  - Timeline, identification of milestones
  - Final report
- A proposal of how the MVP will be assessed
- References

Your audience is your technical Data Science team (*i.e.,* Capstone group members), your technical Data Science supervisor (*i.e.,* Teaching Fellow) and your client (*i.e.,* Capstone partner(s)). Thus the language you use to write the proposal must make it both accessible to all 3 different audiences, as well as techinical and detailed enough such that you can get adequate feedback on the path you are choosing to take with the project.

Some logistic details about the proposal:
- Should be written using reproducible, and version controllable software (*e.g.,* Markdown, LaTeX, *etc*).
- The source document for the proposal (`.md` in case of Markdown, or `.tex` in case of LaTeX), and a rendered `.pdf` document must be submitted.
- Report can be a maximum of 8 pages in length (not including figures, references, code, or appendices).
