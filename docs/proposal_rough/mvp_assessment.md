# MVP Assessment

The MVP of the capstone project is an instructor facing dashboard that instructors can use to gain insight into their online courses. A large part of the challenge in creating such a dashboard is that there are a wide variety of courses and professors with their own preferences as to how they would like the dashboard to function. Thus, due to the subjective nature of this project, it is difficult to assign any numerical metrics as to how the MVP can be assessed. The following is a list of how our MVP may be assessed.

* Satisfaction survey from instructors
* Amount of dashboard web traffic from instructors
* Scalability
* Degree abstract questions can be answered with the dashboard
* Coherence of design

Although the first two suggestions listed above (satisfaction survey and web traffic) would be a useful way of comparing the existing EdX dashboard with our MVP, it does not seem feasible to implement due to the time constraint of the project.

Scalability is an important issue that must be carefully considered. Ideally, the dashboard created for the MVP will be able to be generalized to all EdX courses. As a result, the dashboard can be assessed based on the coverage of EdX courses it can be applied to.

Ultimately, this dashboard is meant to answer questions that instructors have about their courses. The MVP can be assessed in its ability to answer the following questions that are most common amongst instructors:

* How are my students performing?
* How are my students engaging with my course?
* What is the overall structure of my course?
* How can I change my course to be better?

Lastly, the MVP can be assessed by coherence of design and how well our visualizations adheres to visualization theory and best practices. The MVP can be assessed by how well it conforms to the following best practices:

* Select a colour scheme which accommodates those with colour blindness
* Leverage the users ability make visual comparisons versus comparisons via memory
* Have a high level of responsiveness. Don't make the user wait to see results.
* Provide an overview of the data and let the user obtain details on demand through interactivity
* Prioritize function over form and aesthetics
